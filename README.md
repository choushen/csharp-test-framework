# C# Automation Test Suite
## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive automation test suite built using:
- **NUnit** for unit testing
- **Selenium** for browser automation
- **SpecFlow** for BDD-style testing
- **Allure** for generating detailed test reports
- **GitHub** for version control and collaboration
- **Azure Cloud** for CI/CD and cloud-based test execution

The test suite is designed with scalability and parallel test execution in mind, utilizing a thread-safe Bill Pugh-style singleton driver factory.

## Features
- **Scalable Test Execution**: Leverages a thread-safe Bill Pugh Singleton Driver Factory to efficiently manage WebDriver instances for parallel test execution.
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Uses SpecFlow for creating human-readable test cases that can be understood by non-technical stakeholders.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Integrates Allure to provide detailed and interactive test reports.
- **Continuous Integration and Delivery**: Integrated with GitHub for version control and Azure Cloud for automated build, test, and deployment processes.

## Checklist for Enhancements
To fully set up and run this test suite with Allure reporting, GitHub integration, and Azure Cloud, follow this checklist:

### 1. **Allure Reporting Integration**
   - [ ] Add Allure NuGet packages to the project.
   - [ ] Configure NUnit to generate Allure-compatible XML reports.
   - [ ] Set up the Allure command-line tool for report generation.
   - [ ] Modify the CI/CD pipeline to generate and publish Allure reports after each test run.

### 2. **GitHub Integration**
   - [ ] Set up a GitHub repository and push the project to the repository.
   - [ ] Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from version control.
   - [ ] Set up branch protection rules and PR templates for better collaboration.
   - [ ] Implement GitHub Actions for CI/CD or integrate with Azure Pipelines.

### 3. **Azure Cloud Setup**
   - [ ] Create an Azure DevOps project or use GitHub Actions with Azure integration.
   - [ ] Configure a CI/CD pipeline to automatically build, test, and deploy the application.
   - [ ] Set up environment variables and secrets in Azure for secure cloud-based testing.
   - [ ] Implement parallel test execution in the Azure pipeline for faster feedback.
   - [ ] Integrate Allure reports into the Azure pipeline for easy access to test results.
